Selector should be unique in component.ts


PROCESS OF ANGULAR APP starting
--> first main.ts 
--> starts app 
--> bootstraps App Module 
--> bootstrap property App Compoent (All other app component related files) 
--> selector in app component gets rendered in <app-root> element of index.html


web bundler bundles other 3rd party js files and adds to bottom of index.html file which gets served

selectors don't work for id of component or pseudo selectors like :hover and so on
